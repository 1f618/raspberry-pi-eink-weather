# Ansible Raspberry Pi E Ink Weather ü•ß üñãÔ∏è ‚õàÔ∏è

This is an Ansible port of the excellent [Raspberry Pi E-Ink Weather Station using Python](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-e-ink-weather-station-using-python) tutorial, originally created by [Melissa LeBlanc-Williams](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/MakerMelissa) for [Adafruit Industries](https://www.adafruit.com).

**If you want to learn, you should follow that tutorial**.  But if you just want the Raspberry Pi e-ink weather station, **this Ansible playbook will build it for you automatically.** ü™Ñ ‚ú®

Included in this port is an Ansible role, `1f618.circuitpython_on_linux`, which installs CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisites

* A Raspberry Pi, running **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (or full-fledged Raspberry Pi OS), with SSH access already configured and a [Monochrome E-Ink Bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4687) attached
* Ansible
* Installation of the required Ansible Galaxy role(s)
  ```
  ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
  ```

## Usage

* Update `hosts.yml` with the connection details for your Pi
* Update the `location` var in `main.yml`
* Set a `OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN` environment variable
  ```
  OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN=yourtokengoeshere
  ```
* Run the playbook:
  ```
  ansible-playbook main.yml
  ```
